# Adventures in python
A repo for all of my experiments and on-going learning in Python.

My plan for this repo is to accumulate all examples of projects that I've worked on to help in learning specific concepts within Python. Over time, I hope it acts a bit like a journal, so I can look back on my coding journey at a later date and see how I've progressed!
